Visualizing Quranic data from different websites in easy browser accessible, offline capable, iphone friendly webpages.

- just html+js files; can be hosted on any server
- works offline once data is cached. Great plus for using on iphone, ipad etc!
- search works fast! keywords can be entered in Arabic, Buckwalter, Bare, transliteration etc.
- its mashed up with data from other Quran sites. Ex: compare Uthmani and IndoPak mushaf.


Try:
index.html
index2.html


NOTE:
These pages are research tools; not definitive resources. They have their quirks. The code could use some cleanup.
You are welcome to take the idea, improve on it and host on your own site.
